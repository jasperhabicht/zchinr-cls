# Template for ZChinR Journal

This template allows for typesetting issues of the ZChinR (GJCL) journal as well as single articles thereof.

It simplifies typesetting by allowing for setting issue and article options via a key-value system while providing as much automization for typesetting pagination and tables of contents as possible.

The template allows for typesetting PDFs for online use as well as for printing either of full issues or single articles via document class options.

Only open source fonts are used. Typesetting of Chinese is based on XeLaTeX and the `ctex` package.
